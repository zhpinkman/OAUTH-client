# OAUTH-client
A simple client for illustration of the OAUTH usage done in the Network Security course under the supervision of [Dr. Sayyad](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~sayad).

To run the project, you just have to run the `server.js` which is located in the server directory. The index.html and its style file are located in the formmodal directory. After running the server you can access the home page via address : `localhost:5859`. There you can enter your username to use when authorizing the app with github. The functionality of the program is to retrieve the public information available on Github but you can extend.
